# Introduction
This vignette contains examples from every chapter of Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 6e by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge. Each example illustrates how to load data, build econometric models, and compute estimates with R.

In addition, the Appendix cites good sources on using R for econometrics.

Appendix
# Using R for Introductory Econometrics
This is an excellent open source complimentary text to "Introductory Econometrics" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge and should be your number one resource. This excerpt from the book's website:

This book introduces the popular, powerful and free programming language and software package R with a focus on the implementation of standard tools and methods used in econometrics. Unlike other books on similar topics, it does not attempt to provide a self-contained discussion of econometric models and methods. Instead, it builds on the excellent and popular textbook "Introductory Econometrics" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge.

# Applied Econometrics with R
From the publisher's website:

This is the first book on applied econometrics using the R system for statistical computing and graphics. It presents hands-on examples for a wide range of econometric models, from classical linear regression models for cross-section, time series or panel data and the common non-linear models of microeconometrics such as logit, probit and tobit models, to recent semiparametric extensions. In addition, it provides a chapter on programming, including simulations, optimization, and an introduction to R tools enabling reproducible econometric research. An R package accompanying this book, AER, is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AER.
